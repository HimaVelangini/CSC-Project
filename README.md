Using AWS Lambda to send email with SNS for the files stored in S3

In this project, we will use AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service, to create a function that sends email notifications using Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) whenever files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. This setup enables you to stay informed about important events in your S3 storage without needing to manage servers or infrastructure.
